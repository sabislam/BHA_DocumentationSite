# Day 4

### March 18, 2017

#### Mold!

Upon inspection of the terrarium this morning, I found evidence of some fungal growth on the plants.

While conducting research on building terrariums, I had read about mold growing within terrariums soon after set-up. Growth of this type of mold has been mostly attributed to the high humidity of closed-terrariums and contamination (whether it be from the soil used, from spores elsewhere, etc).

To combat the spread of mold, I could disinfect the affected areas with ~20% solution of hydrogen peroxide and/or oncover the tank overnight to allow for aeration, thereby decreasing the humidity within the tank.

However, I am considering doing nothing at all and letting the fungal growths be. I am concerned that they will spread alarmingly, however I have found reports that the growths do dissipate after some time (SOURCE).

I am also considerating taking samples of this fungal growth and analyzing it under a microscope. Perhaps this could be a possible player in the upcoming symphony?

### Concerns:

**1. See above!**

### To-Do:

- identify the species of mold
