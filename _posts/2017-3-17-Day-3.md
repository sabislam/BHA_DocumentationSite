# Day 3

### March 17, 2017

I woke up to find that the closed-system is working as it should be: condensation of water has accumulated on the sides of the glass tank as well as on the acrylic sheet from when I had misted/watered the terrarium after planting. I noticed interesting branching patterns on one of the walls. I am not sure where they're from, but they look cool!

As the plants settle into their new environment, I will try to further look into methods of data collection for this project.

### Concerns:

**1. I noticed that there were two gnats** trapped inside the terrarium. I lifted the acrylic sheet and got them to escape. I'm hoping I won't find anymore of them in the future.
