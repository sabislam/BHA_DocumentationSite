# Day 11

### March 25, 2017

#### This past week

Over the last several days since I last posted, I have let the terrarium be, refraining from fiddling around with the contents. Throughout the week, I occasionally adjusted the position of the acrylic covering, allowing the levels of humidity to decrease in the hopes of lessening the opportunity for fungal growth. While I am not yet sure to what degree this has stunted the spread of fungal growth, the soil in the small environment nearly dried out. Twice this week, I watered the soil and sprayed the plants down.

#### Gnats...

Earlier this evening, I had a closer inspection of the terrarium, instead of simply glancing at it as I had been throughout the week. This was mainly due to the fact that I wanted to add an ornamental piece to the set-up: a piece of wood that I had washed with dishwashing soap (collected from a trip up to the Sandia mountains). While adding the piece contributed to the overall "natural" feel of the terrarium, I discovered what I had feared most about this set-up: a gnat infestation. Laying the piece of wood disturbed the gnats that had been crawling along. As soon as I noticed at least five adult gnats flitting about the walls of tank, I realized that a new organism has made its home within the terrarium.
