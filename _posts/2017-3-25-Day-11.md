# Day 11

### March 25, 2017

#### This past week

Over the last several days since I last posted, I have let the terrarium be, refraining from fiddling around with the contents. Throughout the week, I occasionally adjusted the position of the acrylic covering, allowing the levels of humidity to decrease in the hopes of lessening the opportunity for fungal growth. While I am not yet sure to what degree this has stunted the spread of fungal growth, the soil in the small environment nearly dried out. Twice this week, I watered the soil and sprayed the plants down.

#### Gnats...

Earlier this evening, I had a closer inspection of the terrarium, instead of simply glancing at it as I had been throughout the week. This was mainly due to the fact that I wanted to add an ornamental piece to the set-up: a piece of wood that I had washed with dishwashing soap (collected from a trip up to the Sandia mountains). While adding the piece contributed to the overall "natural" feel of the terrarium, I discovered what I had feared most about this set-up: a gnat infestation. Laying the piece of wood disturbed the gnats that had been crawling along. As soon as I noticed at least five adult gnats flitting about the walls of the tank, I realized that a new organism has made its home within the terrarium.

At first, I berated myself for not having controlled the environment better. I knew that the gnats migrated from the other soil sources I had in the space (at least 10 other potted plants, and one giant bag of potting soil). While I was momentarily frustrated, a sudden thought came to me: what do gnats feed on when trapped in an enclosed space, namely the terrarium? With a quick Google search, I found my answer, and much more, within [The Washington Post's article on gnats](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/post/the-scoop-on-gnats-what-weather-they-like-and-why-they-drive-us-nuts/2011/07/26/gIQAjSyoaI_blog.html?utm_term=.89474ec0fc4e)

**Points of interest:**
  - Gnat larvae live in moist environments
  - Gnats are small flies of the suborder Nematocera
  - Gnats serve a purpose in nature; they are an important food source for birds, bats and larger insects
  - They also pollinate flowers
  - _Gnat larva feast on fungus, algae or plants_
  
I quickly figured that the gnats taking residence in the terrarium are most likely [fungus gnats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus_gnat), those that are common to house plants that especially thrive off of plant roots, decomposing matter, and fungal growths, all of which can definitely be found within the terrarium.
