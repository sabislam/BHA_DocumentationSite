# Day 1

### March 15, 2017

#### The Struggle
One of the most troublesome aspects of this project so far is actually gathering the live materials for the terrarium. I considered purchasing moss online, however I am typically skepticle of purchasing any form of plant that isn't shipped in seed form. I stupidly spent many hours at the local Wal-Mart, Home Depot, PetSmart, Petco, and a certain greenhouse searching for plants viable for a closed-terrarium setup... to, of course, no avail. I had also been hoping to collect specimen from the [Sandia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandia_Mountains), [Santa Fe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe_National_Forest), and/or [Jemez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jemez_Mountains) areas, however the cold weather that permeated throughout January and February prevented me from doing so. I found myself unable to gather habitants for the terrarium until the University's week of Spring Break during March, when things finally started to get warmer. Fortunately, during one of my unsuccessful trips to Wal-mart, a perceptive stranger must have overheard me complaining to my sister about the plant stocks at the superstore's gardening section. She directed me to a local [nursery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_nursery), reassuring me that they carried the plants I had been seeking. And she was right! For the terrarium, I purchased three different types of plants before I went on for assembly:

- [Sagina Irish moss](https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/ornamental/groundcover/irish-moss/growing-irish-moss-plants.htm)
- [Parlor Palm](http://www.guide-to-houseplants.com/parlor-palm.html)
- [Rabbit Foot Fern](http://www.guide-to-houseplants.com/rabbit-foot-fern.html)
- (unidentified)

#### The Assembly

Setting up the terrarium was relatively straightforward:

A layer of rocks at the bottom, following a layer of horticultural charcoal

A mix of peat moss, potting soil, and backyard dirt (sand, clay)

And finally, the plants arranged into the soil

### Concerns

**1. The tank did not come with a cover.** I did not plan ahead and didn't do anything about this until I had finished setting up the terrarium. To maintain the setup of a closed-system, I grabbed the most suitable item I could find in my immediate area: a painting canvas. I used this to cover the top of the terrarium until I could figure out something better to use.

**2. Sanitation is a concern.** Since the rocks I used for drainage came from my backyard, I did take basic sanitary measures and washed the rocks with antibacterial soap before placing them in the tank. However, I did not sterilize the inside of the tank, the dirt from my backyard, nor did I sterilize the canvas. I doubt that this will negatively affect the project as a whole, but only time will tell.

**3. I do not find gnats pleasing.** Unfortunately, with the bags of potting soil nearby, gnats have found their way into my workspace. I am concerned that they will find themselves within the terrarium. I personally would rather not have a gnat infestation inside or outside of the terrarium.

**4. Mountain objects.** (text here)
