# Day 1

### March 15, 2017

One of the most troublesome aspects of this project so far is actually gathering the live materials for the terrarium. I considered purchasing moss online, however I am typically skepticle of purchasing any form of plant that isn't shipped in seed form. I stupidly spent many hours at the local Wal-Mart, Home Depot, PetSmart, Petco, and a certain greenhouse searching for plants viable for a closed-terrarium setup... to, of course, no avail. I had also been hoping to collect specimen from the [Sandia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandia_Mountains), [Santa Fe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe_National_Forest), and/or [Jemez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jemez_Mountains) areas, however the cold weather that permeated throughout January and February prevented me from doing so. I found myself unable to gather habitants for the terrarium until the University's week of Spring Break during March, when things finally started to get warmer. Fortunately, during one of my unsuccessful trips to Wal-mart, a perceptive stranger must have overheard me complaining to my sister about the plant stocks at the superstore's gardening section. She directed me to a local [nursery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_nursery), reassuring me that they carried the plants I had been seeking. And she was right! For the terrarium, I purchased three different types of plants:

- [Sagina Irish moss](https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/ornamental/groundcover/irish-moss/growing-irish-moss-plants.htm)
- [Parlor Palm](http://www.guide-to-houseplants.com/parlor-palm.html)
- [Rabbit Foot Fern](http://www.guide-to-houseplants.com/rabbit-foot-fern.html)
