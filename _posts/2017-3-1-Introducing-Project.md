# Introducing Project

### March 01, 2017

The goal of the project is to create a simulation of a **(1)** self-sustained microecosystem, **(2)** gathering data from each organism/component of this microecosystem, and **(3)** translating these data sets into [generative music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_music). 


#### Self-sustained Microecosystem

A self-sustained microecosystem can be simulated using a [terrarium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrarium)-based model. This model is ideal mostly due to its mobility and accessibility. As tempting as hiking up to the mountains to collect soil and plant samples sounds, frequent trips would become tiring and impractical.

**General aim:** to create a terrarium containing live moss and plants suited for humid/forest floor environments

**Materials:**
1. Container
  + Aquarium tank
2. Drainage System
  + Rocks/pebbles
  + [Horticultural charcoal](https://www.reference.com/home-garden/horticultural-charcoal-178ec666b42d1aba)
3. Soil
  + Potting Mix
  + [Peat Moss](https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/garden-how-to/soil-fertilizers/peat-moss-information.htm)
4. Plants
  + ferns
  + moss
  + _any plant adapted for humidity/indirect-light invironment_
  + _NOT succulents!!_
5. Microorganisms (optional)
  + beneficial bacteria
  + [slime mold](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/the-sublime-slime-mold/)
  + _???_


#### Data Collection

Some form of data collection should occur as soon as terrarium has been stablized (set up, troubleshooting, etc). At the moment, I am unsure what direction I should take in this regard. Listed below are ideas for data collection:

+ monitoring nitrogen (+more) composition in soil
+ motion-capture recording of plant growth/etc
+ monitoring levels of moisture within system
+ collecting samples of system components and culturing them/visualizing them under microscope
+ _???_


#### Data Translation

Some form of data transformation/translation should occur as soon as some data has been collected from the terrarium. The **general aim** is to attribute orchestral instruments to each data set so that by the end of this project, a symphony of music has been composed. Some ideas for what tech to use are listed below

+ [MIDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI) use
+ [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) (program)
+ Arduino
