# Introducing Project

### March 01, 2017

The goal of the project is to create a simulation of a **(1)** self-sustained microecosystem, **(2)** gathering data from each organism/component of this microecosystem, and **(3)** translating these data sets into [generative music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_music). 

#### Self-sustained Microecosystem

A self-sustained microecosystem can be simulating using a [terrarium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrarium)-based model. This model is ideal mostly due to its mobility and accessibility. As tempting as hiking up to the mountains to collect soil and plant samples sounds, frequent trips would become tiring and impractical.

**General aim:** to create a terrarium containing live moss and plants suited for humid/forest floor environments

**Materials:**
1. Container
2. Drainage System
3. Soil
4. Plants
5. Microorganisms

#### Data Collection

#### Data Translation
