# Day 2

### March 16, 2017

For the terrarium's cover, I purchased transparent acrylic sheets and had them cut to the top of the tank's measurements. I replaced the canvas with the sheet, and sure enough, it made a whole of a lot of difference. With the sheet, the terrarium can be directly observed from above as well.

### Concerns

**1. I should have santized** the acrylic sheet before placing it over the tank. I'm starting to wonder if I should wear gloves from now on as well whenever I'm handling the tank....
