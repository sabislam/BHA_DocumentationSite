# Day 2

### March 16, 2017

For the terrarium's cover, I purchased transparent acrylic sheets and had them cut to the top of the tank's measurements. I replaced the canvas with the sheet, and sure enough, it made a whole of a lot of difference. With the sheet, the terrarium can be directly observed from above as well.
