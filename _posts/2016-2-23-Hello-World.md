# Who am I?

### Feb 14, 2017

As of spring 2017, I am a third-year undergraduate student at the University of New Mexico in New Mexico, United States. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's of Science degree in Biochemistry, with minors in Spanish and Psychology. I hope to go on to graduate school for Public Health (MSPH/DrPh).

I found the BioHacking Academy through [Andrea Polli](http://www.andreapolli.com/), who has previously participated in BHA3. I am very excited to see where this course takes me, as I've always been fascinated by DIY projects that allows you to incorporate biotechnology and design.

All the best,

Sabrina I
